1.Wireframes and prototyping are very useful for establishing the scope of a project. 
 They aid in helping you identify all the different screens you might need to design 
 and links that you may need for additional functionality. Beyond the 5 pages you 
 designed for the project. When prototyping your wireframe designs, what additional 
 pages have you discovered would need to be created/designed in your site?

I discovered that i will need to create a page for the charity section ,maybe a voting page and 
a popup window for newsletter subscription.





2.Prototyping really helps in the working out functionality issues. Did your group work 
out any functionality problems or design flaws while prototyping your wireframes? If so, 
please list and describe the problem.

I created an image slider for my home page hero .But the buttons currently only goes one way and 
would not go back to the default hero slider.i would be researching in order to fix the issue for 
greater user experience .
